# Intro_Data_Vis_R

Talk on data visualization with R. The focus is on using ggplot2, but I will also give a very brief intro to the R environment.

The ".R" file will be used for during the tutorial. The ".html" file can be used for your reference at a later time. The ".Rmd" file is what I used to make the ".html" file, if you're curious!

Use the ".docx" file for following the tutorial at a later date! (Having problems with the other file types..)
