# Intro_Data_Vis_R

Talk on *introductory* data visualization with R. The focus is on using ggplot2, but I will also give a very brief intro to the R environment.

The ".R" file will be used for during the tutorial. The PDF file can be used for your reference at a later time. The ".Rmd" file is what I used to make the PDF, if you're curious!

What to do before coming:

- Install R Studio [https://www.rstudio.com/]
